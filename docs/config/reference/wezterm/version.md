# `wezterm.version`

This constant is set to the `wezterm` version string that is also reported
by running `wezterm -V`.  This can potentially be used to adjust configuration
according to the installed version.

The version string looks like `20200406-151651-5b700e4`.  You can compare the
strings lexicographically if you wish to test whether a given version is newer
than another; the first component is the date on which the release was made,
the second component is the time and the final component is a git hash.

!!! warning "Pending rhai conversion"

    The code example(s) below still use Lua syntax from before OnlyTerm's
    config engine switched to rhai. The *option names, event names and
    object/method shapes* are unchanged -- only the scripting syntax differs.
    See the [migration guide](../../../migration-lua-to-rhai.md) for the Lua-to-rhai
    syntax mapping to translate this example yourself, or watch for a
    follow-up documentation pass that rewrites it directly.

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
wezterm.log_error('Version ' .. wezterm.version)
```
