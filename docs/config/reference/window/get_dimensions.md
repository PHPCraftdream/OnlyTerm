# `window.get_dimensions()`

!!! danger "Removed: no scripting engine"

    This page documents part of the rhai (and, before that, Lua) **scripting
    API**, which has been removed entirely. OnlyTerm's configuration format
    is now [ktav](../../../migration-to-ktav.md), a static `key: value` data
    format with no expressions, function calls, or callbacks of any kind --
    there is nothing left in OnlyTerm that could call this function, invoke
    this method, or construct this object. The description and examples
    below are kept for historical reference (e.g. if you're migrating a very
    old config and trying to understand what it used to do), but none of it
    is callable today. See the [changelog](../../../changelog.md#continuousnightly)
    for the full rationale.

Returns a rhai map representing the dimensions for the Window.

The map has the following fields:

- `pixel_width`: the width of the window in pixels
- `pixel_height`: the height of the window in pixels
- `dpi`: The DPI of the screen the window in on
- `is_full_screen`: whether the window is in full screen mode
